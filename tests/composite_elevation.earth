CompositeElevation

This example demonstrates how to load multiple heightfield layers and treat them as one.

Note: Gaps, peaks, and valleys in the visualization are due to missing data in the source
files. This is not a bug! A good technique for fixing this would be to provide a world-wide
lo-res heightfield underlay.
