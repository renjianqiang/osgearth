osgEarth Sample - Simple Model Driver
Demonstates how to place a model at a location using a model layer.
If you do not specify a location the model is loaded as is to the scene graph so
needs to be absolutely positioned.

    <Model name="Cow in the Hudson">
        <url>cow.osg.(0,0,3.14).trans.100.scale</url>
